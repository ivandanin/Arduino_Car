# Arduino_Car

That is a university project initiated by me.
I've wanted to figure out the principes of IoT.

The Arduino car is as simple as possible.
I've used a Wi-Fi Module - ESP8266 Lolin NodeMCU v3 and a L298N driver.
The code is implemented via USB to the Wi-Fi module.

The control application I've used is unfortunately only for Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluino.esp8266wifirobotcar&hl=en_US&gl=US
